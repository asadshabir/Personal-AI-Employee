# Client Project Brief — Summary and Action List

## Source
- **Original file:** `Inbox/test_task.txt`
- **Detected type:** task
- **Auto-priority:** P2
- **Processed by:** [Skill_File_Processor](../Skills/Skill_File_Processor.md) (SK-010)

## Original Content

Client has provided a short project brief.
We need a clear summary and a practical action list for execution.

The AI Employee must:
- Understand the request
- Generate a structured summary
- Produce an actionable checklist
- Follow the SK-010 → SK-011 → SK-012 processing pipeline

### Deliverable 1: Structured Summary

**Project Brief Summary**

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Request Type** | Content transformation — raw brief to structured deliverables |
| **Client Need** | A clear, professional summary of their project brief and a practical action list they can execute against |
| **Core Requirements** | (1) Understand the inbound request (2) Generate a structured summary (3) Produce an actionable checklist |
| **Processing Pipeline** | SK-010 (intake/classify) → SK-011 (triage/prioritize) → SK-012 (analyze/plan/execute) |
| **Priority** | P2 — Standard work item |
| **Complexity** | Simple — 3 execution steps, no external dependencies |
| **Constraints** | All work must be local-first, auditable, and follow the Company Handbook |

**Key Observations:**
- The brief is intentionally concise — it describes a process validation task rather than a detailed project scope.
- The primary value is demonstrating the AI Employee's ability to receive, interpret, and act on an inbound request through the full skill pipeline.
- No ambiguities or missing requirements were identified. All four stated requirements are directly addressable.

### Deliverable 2: Actionable Execution Checklist

**Execution Checklist**

| # | Action | Owner | Status |
|---|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Receive inbound file in `/Inbox` and validate format, size, and content safety | SK-010 (File Processor) | Done |
| 2 | Classify file type as task, enrich with frontmatter, route to `/Needs_Action` | SK-010 (File Processor) | Done |
| 3 | Assign priority (P2), set status to ready, record transition history | SK-011 (Task Manager) | Done |
| 4 | Read and analyze the task request — extract intent, deliverables, complexity | SK-012 (Task Executor) | Done |
| 5 | Generate execution plan in `/Plans/PLAN_test-task.md` with numbered steps and success criteria | SK-012 (Task Executor) | Done |
| 6 | Execute plan Step 1 — analyze client brief, extract core requirements and constraints | SK-012 (Task Executor) | Done |
| 7 | Execute plan Step 2 — produce structured summary covering what, why, and key details | SK-012 (Task Executor) | Done |
| 8 | Execute plan Step 3 — produce actionable checklist with sequencing and ownership | SK-012 (Task Executor) | Done |
| 9 | Write all results back into the task file (append, not overwrite) | SK-012 (Task Executor) | Done |
| 10 | Run 7-point completion verification checklist | SK-012 (Task Executor) | Done |
| 11 | Mark `status: done` in frontmatter after all checks pass | SK-012 (Task Executor) | Done |
| 12 | Move completed task to `/Done`, write audit log to `/Logs` | SK-011 (Task Manager) | Done |

### Decisions Made
- Classified as Tier 0 — no external calls or system modifications required
- Complexity assessed as simple (3 steps) — minimal plan structure used
- Summary format uses table layout for scannability per Handbook §2.2
- Checklist includes the full pipeline steps (SK-010 through SK-012) for end-to-end traceability
