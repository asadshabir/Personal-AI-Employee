# 🥉 Bronze Tier - Personal AI Employee

> Foundation tier of the Personal AI Employee system with core autonomous task execution capabilities.

## 📋 Overview

The Bronze Tier represents the foundational AI Employee system implementing a complete autonomous task execution pipeline with constitutional governance, skill architecture, and full auditability.

## 🏗️ Core Components

### 🤖 **AI Employee System**

The core AI Employee system operates through this pipeline:

```
📁 /Inbox → 🔍 Filesystem Watcher → ⏳ /Needs_Action → 🧠 Orchestrator → 🛠️ Skills → ✅ /Done
```

#### **filesystem_watcher.py**
- Monitors the `/Inbox` directory for new task files
- Extracts metadata and classifies content
- Creates prioritized tasks in `/Needs_Action`
- Prevents reprocessing of the same files
- Logs all processing actions to `/Logs`

#### **orchestrator.py**
- Polls `/Needs_Action` for pending tasks
- Invokes Claude to process tasks using defined skills
- Implements completion-driven loops (only completes when `status: done` is written)
- Manages retry policies and error handling
- Moves completed tasks to `/Done`
- Writes comprehensive audit logs

#### **Company_Handbook.md (v2.0)**
- Constitutional authority governing all AI behavior
- 10-section framework: Mission, Communication, Approval Rules, Task Lifecycle, Logging, Error Handling, Self-Check, Security, File Naming, Amendment Process
- Immutable rules preventing unauthorized behavior modification
- 4-Tier Approval System (0-3) with clear boundaries

### 🛠️ **Skill Architecture**

#### **Skill Base (SK-BASE)**
- Universal contract defining required sections for all skills
- Standardized interface: Detection → Validation → Authorization → Execution → Logging → Output → Verification
- Safety constraints and error handling protocols
- Skill chaining capabilities with depth limits

#### **File Processor (SK-010)**
- **Tier**: 0 (Autonomous)
- **Function**: Task intake, validation, classification, and routing
- **Process**: Detect → Read → Validate → Classify → Enrich/Route → Reject → Log
- **Security**: Built-in secret detection to halt processing

#### **Task Manager (SK-011)**
- **Tier**: 0 (Autonomous)
- **Function**: Task lifecycle transitions and priority management
- **Process**: Triage → Start → Complete → Block → Reject → Return → Log
- **Features**: Auto-priority assignment (P0-P3), transition history, immutable completed tasks

#### **Task Executor (SK-012)**
- **Tier**: 0 (Autonomous)
- **Function**: Primary reasoning loop for task execution
- **Process**: Read → Analyze → Plan → Execute → Update → Verify → Signal
- **Verification**: 7-point completion checklist before marking `status: done`
- **Protection**: Stale loop detection to prevent infinite cycles

*Example files created during validation

## 🔄 Task Lifecycle

1. 📥 **Inbox**: Task files enter the system
2. 🔍 **File Processor (SK-010)**: Validates, classifies, and creates tasks in `/Needs_Action`
3. ⚙️ **Orchestrator**: Polls for tasks and routes to appropriate skills
4. 🧠 **Task Executor (SK-012)**: 7-step reasoning loop with verification
5. ✅ **Done**: Tasks complete with full audit trail only when `status: done` is written

## ✅ Bronze Tier Validation

The Bronze Tier system has passed a comprehensive 7-point validation audit:

| Check | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Task moved Inbox → Needs_Action → Done | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | PLAN_test_task.md exists with numbered steps | ✅ PASS |
| 3 | Task file contains execution history (append-only) | ✅ PASS |
| 4 | status: done written only after checklist verification | ✅ PASS |
| 5 | No files were deleted or overwritten | ✅ PASS |
| 6 | Logs were generated throughout execution | ✅ PASS |
| 7 | System is ready for another task without reset | ✅ PASS |

**Overall Result: 7/7 PASS**

## 🛡️ Safety & Security

- 🔐 **Secret Detection**: Halts processing if sensitive data detected
- 📜 **Append-Only History**: Never overwrites existing files
- ⚖️ **Constitutional Limits**: Strict adherence to Company Handbook
- 🔄 **Stale Loop Protection**: Automatic halting after 3 repeated cycles
- 📊 **Full Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all decisions and transitions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Place task files in the `/Inbox` directory
3. Run `filesystem_watcher.py` to monitor for new tasks
4. Run `orchestrator.py` to process pending tasks
5. Monitor progress in `/Needs_Action`, `/Done`, and `/Logs`

## 📈 Next Tiers
