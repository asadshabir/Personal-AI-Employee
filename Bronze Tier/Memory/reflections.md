# 🧘 Reflections Log

> **Purpose**: This file stores structured self-evaluation records after each completed task. It serves as an append-only log of execution quality assessments that enable continuous optimization and learning.

## 📋 **Reflection Template**

## ⭐ **Scoring Rubric**

### Plan Quality Score (1-5)
- **5**: Plan was comprehensive, all steps were relevant, success criteria were precise and complete
- **4**: Plan was mostly comprehensive with only minor omissions
- **3**: Plan was adequate but had some unclear steps or criteria
- **2**: Plan had significant gaps that required improvisation
- **1**: Plan was incomplete or fundamentally flawed

### Execution Efficiency Score (1-5)
- **5**: All steps completed as planned, no resource waste, optimal path followed
- **4**: Nearly all steps completed as planned with minor inefficiencies
- **3**: Most steps completed with some rework needed
- **2**: Significant rework or detours required during execution
- **1**: Execution required major improvisation or failed steps

### Memory Usage Effectiveness (1-5)
- **5**: Memory recall was highly relevant, influenced planning positively, avoided known failures
- **4**: Memory recall was mostly relevant and helpful
- **3**: Memory recall was somewhat helpful but limited impact
- **2**: Memory recall was minimally helpful or only partially applied
- **1**: Memory recall was not effectively used or had no impact
