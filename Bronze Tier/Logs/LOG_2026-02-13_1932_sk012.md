# Execution Log — SK-012 Task Executor

## Action Taken
Full 7-step reasoning loop executed on task "Client Project Brief — Summary and Action List":
1. Read and parsed task file from /Needs_Action
2. Analyzed request: intent, deliverables, complexity (simple), tier (0), risks (low)
3. Generated execution plan: Plans/PLAN_test-task.md (3 steps)
4. Executed all 3 plan steps — produced structured summary + 12-item actionable checklist
5. Updated task file with execution results (appended, not overwritten)
6. Ran 7-point completion checklist — ALL PASSED
7. Wrote status: done, signaled orchestrator

## Input
- Task: Needs_Action/2026-02-13_test-task.md
- Source: Inbox/test_task.txt
- Priority: P2
- Classification: task
- Cycle: 1

## Output
- Plan created: Plans/PLAN_test-task.md (3/3 steps completed, all success criteria met)
- Deliverable 1: Structured summary table (6 fields covering request type, need, requirements, pipeline, priority, constraints)
- Deliverable 2: Actionable execution checklist (12 sequenced items with ownership and status)
- Task moved to: Done/2026-02-13_test-task.md

## Decisions Made
- Tier assessment: 0 (no external calls, no system modifications)
- Complexity: simple (3 steps, no chaining to domain skills needed)
- Summary format: table layout for scannability per Handbook §2.2
- Noted that brief is intentionally sparse — summarized what exists, flagged limited detail explicitly
