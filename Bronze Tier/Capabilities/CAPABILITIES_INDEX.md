# 💪 Capabilities Index

> **Master Registry** of operational capabilities for the AI Employee system. Capabilities represent the fundamental actions the system can perform. Unlike Skills (which provide reasoning and decision-making), Capabilities execute the actual operations.

## 🏗️ **Capability Architecture**

### **Relationship to Skills**
```
Skills (Reasoning Layer)
├── Task Analysis
├── Decision Making
├── Planning
├── Coordination
└── Validation
    ↓
Capabilities (Execution Layer)
├── File Operations (CP-001)
├── [System Operations]
├── [Network Operations]
└── [External API Calls]
```

### **Key Principles**
- **Skills Orchestrate, Capabilities Execute**: Skills define what should happen, capabilities handle how it happens
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All capabilities must operate within Company Handbook boundaries
- **Full Traceability**: Every capability operation is logged per Handbook §5
- **Append-Only Safety**: Where applicable, capabilities use append-only patterns to preserve history
- **Skill-Driven**: Capabilities never act autonomously; they respond to skill requests

## 📊 **Capability Lifecycle**

### **Development Process**
1. **Definition**: Capability requirements documented with purpose, allowed/forbidden actions
2. **Approval**: Capability design reviewed against constitutional constraints (Tier 0-1)
3. **Implementation**: Capability code and documentation created
4. **Testing**: Capability validated for safety and effectiveness
5. **Registration**: Capability added to this index
6. **Activation**: Capability becomes available for skill use

### **Status Definitions**
- **Draft**: Capability design in progress
- **Review**: Capability under constitutional approval review
- **Active**: Capability operational and available for use
- **Deprecated**: Capability no longer recommended for new use
- **Suspended**: Capability temporarily unavailable due to issues

---

## 🚀 **Available Capabilities**

### **CP-001 - Workspace Interaction**
- **Purpose**: Controlled file operations within workspace
- **Scope**: Reading, creating, appending to files in approved directories
- **Safety**: Append-only operations, constitutional compliance
- **Skills**: Used by all skills requiring file operations
- **Documentation**: [CP-001_Workspace_Interaction.md](./CP-001_Workspace_Interaction.md)

---

## 🛡️ **Governance Framework**

### **Constitutional Integration**
- All capabilities must comply with Company Handbook rules
- Tier enforcement applies to capability operations
- Error handling follows constitutional E1-E4 protocols
- Logging requirements must be met for all operations

### **Safety Mechanisms**
- **Operation Boundaries**: Capabilities cannot exceed defined scope
- **Authorization Layer**: Skills must validate before using capabilities
- **Audit Trail**: Every capability operation logged with full context
- **Reversibility**: Where possible, operations can be traced and verified
