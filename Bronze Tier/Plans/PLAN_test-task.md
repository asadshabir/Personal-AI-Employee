# PLAN — Client Project Brief — Summary and Action List

## Objective
Analyze the client's project brief, produce a structured summary that captures all key points, and generate a practical actionable checklist for execution.

## Deliverables
1. Structured summary of the client project brief
2. Actionable execution checklist with clear, sequenced steps

## Execution Steps
1. [x] Analyze the client brief — extract core request, requirements, and constraints | Expected output: internal analysis notes
2. [x] Generate structured summary — produce a professional, concise summary document covering what the client needs, why, and key details | Expected output: markdown summary section
3. [x] Produce actionable checklist — create a numbered, practical checklist of execution steps with clear ownership and sequencing | Expected output: markdown checklist section

## Success Criteria
- [x] Summary accurately reflects the client brief without adding or omitting information
- [x] Checklist contains concrete, actionable items (not vague)
- [x] Each checklist item is sequenced logically
- [x] Output is written back into the task file
- [x] No information was fabricated beyond what the brief states

## Dependencies
- None — self-contained task

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Brief is vague — limited detail to summarize | Summarize what exists, flag gaps explicitly |

## Rollback
Remove appended execution result section from the task file. Plan file remains for audit.
